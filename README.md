<h3> Usage </h3>
This is a proxy website. it's super basic and incredibly unreliable sometimes. considering it runs an engine thats almost 6 years old. <br>
Despite this it can open just about any website you can think of from Youtube to instagram.

<h3> Note </h3>
<small> to a small percentage who use this for bypassing school firewalls that are using it INSCHOOL please im begging you, use this discretely so the domain doesnt have to be changed for everyone, this is a request for no cost but to have the same domain.
